===========
No More Room in Hell
This readme is for the Half-Life 2 Source Mod "No More Room in Hell".

The main purpose of this repository is to submit any bugs or issues present in the modification.

Reporting Issues

If you would like to report an issue you've found in the mod, please check the issue list to see if it's been reported. Include closed issues in your search.

Also consult this link for preexisting issues (we'll slowly move the current issues over to this system, but feel free to help out)

If the issue hasn't been reported yet, submit it in GitHub with the following information:

A short descriptive title
Detailed information of the issue (what happens if it occurs, etc.) along with any screenshots or output from the developer console (accessible in game via ` key)
Steps on how to reproduce the issue (How did you do it?)
And if possible, system information*
Place Developer Console output in a blockquote (Press M while in your web browser for a cheat sheet on how to do that)

*Easiest way to obtain your system information is through Steam (Help > System Information). Copy and paste all of that information into your bug report, in a blockquote.

**If your game crashes*

If while playing NMRiH, you inexplicably get thrown to the desktop with an error window (hl2.exe has stopped responding), do the following:

Don't close the game until the error window gives you a prompt to close it (when the OK button appears)
Follow the same directions as mentioned above in Reporting Issues but:
Before you submit the issue, check your Source SDK Base 2007 folder (located in steam\steamapps\youraccount\source sdk base 2007) to see if there's a newly generated .mdmp file
If there is, upload and attach it to your issue ticket and then submit it
Code of Conduct

Since this will ideally be used by the public to help centralize and organize the issues present in the mod, the team would appreciate if you can remember the following:

Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.
Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
Avoid using ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.
Do not repeatably update an open issue, saying that the issue persists.
Do not use exploits for your own gain, this tracker is up in goodwill to allow the public to help the dev team out with bug reporting.
Reminder: NMRiH is a HL2 modification so some issues that you'll find may be common throughout various Source 2007 based mods (ex: clientregistry.blob error) or may not even be issues at all.

Feature Requests

To a lesser extent you can request certain things for the team to look into, such as new specific entities that mappers can use to make more creative objectives. However, we'll overlook requests that are either ill-fitting for the mod's subject or just plain silly (we are not adding handheld GAU-8 Avengers or zombified animals).
